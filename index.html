            <h1>Benefits of <span class="heading-color">Biotechnology in Food</span> </h1>
            <p>Food biotechnology is the use of technology to modify the genes of our food sources which are animals,
                plants,
                and microorganisms for producing more, survive in tough condition & healthy.
                <br>
                Modifying plants, animals and microorganisms through methods of genetic
                modification that are being used to introduce diverse
                beneficial characteristics.

            <h1>Genetically Modified Organisms(GMO)</h2>
                <p>
                    GMO crops are crops that have been safely genetically engineered to have new traits such as
                    increased vitamin
                    availability, drought resistance and pest tolerance.These foods increasing yields, supporting
                    conservation and building sustainability.Some common GMO food:
                <ul>
                    <li>Corn</li>
                    <li>Soybean</li>
                    <li>Cotton</li>
                    <li>Potato</li>
                    <li>Brinjal</li>

        <h2 class="align-center">Importance of biotechnology in food production</h2>
        <p class="align-center">Use of biotech plants can produce more food on less land, by reducing the amount <br> of
            crops lost to disease and
            pests. It can reduce CO2 emissions from the farming process</p>

                    <p>There are certain biotech foods are designed to be resistant to pests and diseases. It allows
                        farmers to use fewer chemicals, like pesticides and herbicides, while still maintaining a
                        healthy, high-yielding crop</p>

                    <p>Crops that are designed to thrive under harsh conditions like heat, cold, drought, etc. will help
                        to provide economic benefits to farmers. </p>
